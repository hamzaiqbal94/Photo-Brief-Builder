        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The product Photoshoot Brief Builder offers a simple and direct solution. Art directors use the drop down menus on this web-based product to specify the technical, ambient and content delivery preferences which then generates a printable (or screenshot-able) note card that supplies all the information needed to capture the desired image. In case of product photography, one such note card can be attached to each product, and used to lead workflow during the shoot.
        </p>
        <br>
      <p>Currently, the form is configured for product photography shoots, with fields that include intended usage of content, number of final shots required, format of files required, image orientation, camera lens to be used, photo lighting, photo lighting add-ons, camera angle, camera perspective, and behind the scene footage. </p>
